<h2>Self-shrinkers for mean curvature flow</h2>
<p>
Mean curvature flow can be defined as the gradient flow of area 
which means that it deforms a given surface such that its area decreases the fastest. 
Surfaces which shrink homothetically under mean curvature flow without changing their shape are called self-shrinkers. 
They are of great importance for the general theory of mean curvature flow because they model local singularities developing along the flow.
</p>
<p>
In his lecture notes on mean curvature flow, Ilmanen conjectured the existence of noncompact self-shrinkers with arbitrary genus. 
Min-max techniques allow a rigorous existence proof for these surfaces. 
Conjecturally, they have precisely one asymptotically conical end. 
For large genus this can be confirmed via a precise analysis of the limiting object of sequences of such self-shrinkers for which the genus tends to infinity.
